## Time

~ 8 hrs. It took longer than it might have because I wasn't sure about the policy on gen AI usage so I chose to use almost none. I'd also never really used IndexedDB before so I took it as an opportunity to learn something new.

## Shortcuts:

- Began with starter project I use sometimes. It's basically vite-react-ts with a TS and ESLint settings that I like.
- React-DnD library for help with drag and drop functionality
- I had Chat GPT spit out some basic color palettes and generate me an "X" SVG
